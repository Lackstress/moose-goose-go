### 2. Fixed Multiplayer Server System ✅
**Files Modified:**
- `server.js` - Enhanced create-room and join-room handlers
- `multiplayer-manager.js` - Updated getRoomData to include hostName, maxPlayers, and gameUrl
- `public/index.html` - Added rooms-list-update event listener

**Key Fixes:**

#### Problem 1: Room Creation Not Visible to Other Players
**Solution:**
- Added broadcast after room creation: `io.emit('rooms-list-update', ...)`
- All clients now receive updated room list immediately

#### Problem 2: Room Data Missing Critical Fields
**Solution:**
- Updated `getRoomData()` to include:
  - `hostName` - Host username for display
  - `maxPlayers` - Room capacity
  - `gameUrl` - Direct link to game

#### Problem 3: No Real-Time Updates
**Solution:**
- Added `rooms-list-update` event handler in index.html
- Servers update in real-time when new rooms are created or joined

### Fullscreen Modal Structure
```
<div id="fullscreenGameModal" class="fullscreen-game-modal">

  │   └── .fullscreen-controls
  │       └── Exit button
  └── .fullscreen-container

Server: create room & add player
  ↓
Server: emit 'room-created' to creator
  ↓
Server: emit 'rooms-list-update' to all clients
