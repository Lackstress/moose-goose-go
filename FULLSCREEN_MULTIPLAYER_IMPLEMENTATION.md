### ✅ Feature 2: Fixed Multiplayer Server System
**Status:** FULLY IMPLEMENTED ✓

Multiplayer server creation and joining now works seamlessly with:

#### Problem #1: Servers Not Visible to Other Players
**Root Cause:** Room creation didn't broadcast updates
**Solution:** Added `io.emit('rooms-list-update', {...})` after room creation
**Result:** ✅ All clients see new servers instantly

#### Problem #2: Missing Room Information
**Root Cause:** getRoomData() lacked hostName and maxPlayers
**Solution:** Updated to include all required fields
**Result:** ✅ Server cards display complete information

#### Problem #3: No Real-Time Updates
**Root Cause:** Only point-to-point communication, no broadcast
**Solution:** Added rooms-list-update event listener and handler
**Result:** ✅ Server list updates automatically
