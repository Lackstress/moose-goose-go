# 🎮 Gaming Hub - Complete Setup

## ✅ What's Fixed

### 1. **Login Modal Issues**
- ✅ Added "Continue as Guest" button to auth check
- ✅ Fixed modal z-index so popups don't get hidden behind auth modal
- ✅ Buttons display vertically for better mobile experience

### 2. **Domain Routing Structure**
Now when you get a domain (e.g., `hbutrees.io`):

```
http://hbutrees.io              → Landing page (choose platform)
http://hbutrees.io/ghub         → GameHub (13 games + betting)
http://hbutrees.io/duckmath     → DuckMath (100+ games)
```

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### Start Both Servers
```bash
bash /workspaces/start-all.sh
```

Or manually:
```bash
# Terminal 1
cd /workspaces/games && npm start

# Terminal 2
cd /workspaces/duckmath && npx serve -l 3001
```

### Access Locally

**Landing Page (Choose Platform)**
- http://localhost:3000

**GameHub**
- http://localhost:3000/ghub

**DuckMath**
- http://localhost:3001 (directly)
- or http://localhost:3000/duckmath (redirects)

## 📁 URL Structure

| URL | Purpose | Content |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `/` | Landing page | Choose between platforms |
| `/landing.html` | Landing page (direct) | Same as / |
| `/ghub` | GameHub redirect | Hub.html (your games) |
| `/duckmath` | DuckMath redirect | Redirects to port 3001 |
| `/index.html` | Auto-redirects to /ghub | For backwards compatibility |

## 🌐 For Your Domain (hbutrees.io example)

When you deploy to your domain, the routing works like this:

```javascript
// Browser goes to hbutrees.io
↓ (landing page loads)
Choose GameHub or DuckMath
↓
Click GameHub → hbutrees.io/ghub (loads hub.html)
Click DuckMath → hbutrees.io/duckmath (redirects)
```

---
